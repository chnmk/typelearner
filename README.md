# typelearner

A Nuxt single page application for language learning.

Provides an interactive typing practice environment for random sentences fetched from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/).

Please note that the main purpose of this project is webdev practice. While I do have an intent of turning it into a viable language learning tool, it isn't my highest priority at the moment.

This verion was built with Nuxt, Pinia and Vuetify.

### TODO

- Interface localization
- History scrolling
- Proper authentication
- Scalability for new languages
- UI redisign
- Better metrics
