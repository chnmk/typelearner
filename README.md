# typelearner

A Vue single page application for language learning.
 
Provides an interactive typing practice environment for random sentences fetched from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/).

Please note that the main purpose of this project is webdev practice. I currently have no intent of turning it into a serious language learning tool.

This verion was built with Nuxt and Vuetify.

### TODO

* Words per minute metric
* Russian interface
* History scrolling
* Authentication (?)
* About page
* Code refactoring
* Better scalability and more languages support
