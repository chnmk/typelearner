# typelearner

A Vue single page application for language learning.
 
Provides an interactive typing practice environment for random sentences fetched from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/).

Please note that the main purpose of this project is webdev practice. I currently have no intent of turning it into a serious language learning tool.

Original project template generated with Vue CLI 5.0.8.

The rewrite-vite-vuex-typescript branch is a (over-engineered) rewrite of this project using create-vue, vite, vuex, vue-router and typescript.
